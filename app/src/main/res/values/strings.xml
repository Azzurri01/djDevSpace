                                My name is Dimitri Johannes and I see myself as a hardworking individual with development dreams.\n\n

                                My hobbies include football, cricket, software development and socializing on my free days. \n\n

                                I currently employed as a disaster recovery specialist and hold a diploma from
                                Cape Peninsula University of Technology in application development.\n\n

                                Some of my certifications include backup and storage related software as well as ITIL.  I am well versed
                                in development languages like SQL, Java, Python and Andriod Studio.\n\n

                                My short term goal is to become a full time developer using real world objects so that
                                I can start addressing my long term goals to possibly come up with solutions to do my part in
                                addressing some of the issues we are currently faced with. \n\n

                                New technologies is on the rise and we are in an era where anything is possible if you apply
                                your mind to it. We can achieve great things if we work towards a common goal together.\n\n

                                Change is coming and I cannot wait to do my part to use technology to unlock
                                the potential many of us deserve.\n
